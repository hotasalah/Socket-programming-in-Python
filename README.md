# Socket-programming-in-Python
Building a multiconnection client-server application using the main functions and methods in Python’s socket module, and sending messages and data between endpoints.

## Overview
Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). The network can be a logical, local network to the computer, or one that’s physically connected to an external network, with its own connections to other networks. The obvious example is the Internet, which you connect to via your ISP.
